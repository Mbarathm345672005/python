# Image Flipping Using PIL

This Python program uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to flip an image horizontally.

## How It Works

1. The program opens an image file named `flip.jpg`.
2. It flips the image from left to right (horizontal flip).
3. The flipped image is saved as `new_img.jpg`.
4. A message is printed to indicate that the flipping is done.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the `Pillow` library installed. You can install it using pip:
2. Place the image you want to flip in the same directory as the program and name it `flip.jpg`.
3. Run the program. The flipped image will be saved as `new_img.jpg`.
