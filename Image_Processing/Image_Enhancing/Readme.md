# Image Enhancement Using CLAHE and OpenCV

This Python program uses the OpenCV library to enhance an image by applying Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE).

## How It Works

1. The program reads an image file named `cr.jpg`.
2. It converts the image to grayscale.
3. It applies the CLAHE algorithm to enhance the contrast of the grayscale image.
4. The enhanced image is saved as `new_img2.jpg`.
5. A message is printed to indicate that the enhancement is done.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the `opencv-python` library installed. You can install it using pip:
2. Place the image you want to enhance in the same directory as the program and name it `cr.jpg`.
3. Run the program. The enhanced image will be saved as `new_img2.jpg`.
