# Monty Hall Game Simulation

### Description

This project simulates the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario where a contestant chooses one of three doors, behind one of which is a car (BMW) and behind the other two are goats. The contestant can then choose to swap or keep their choice.

### Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed to run the script. The script uses the random module, which is included in the standard Python library.

### How It Works

The script initializes three doors, with one randomly assigned to have a BMW behind it, and the others having goats.

The user selects a door.

The program reveals a goat from the remaining two doors.

The user has the option to swap their choice or stick with their original choice.

The program tracks the number of wins when swapping vs. not swapping.

This process repeats 10 times to provide insights into the probabilities.

### Usage

Run the script using:

python script.py

When prompted, enter a number between 0 and 2 to select a door. Then choose whether to swap (Y) or not. The script will keep track of your success rate.
