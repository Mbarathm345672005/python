# Spiral Dot Pattern Using Turtle Graphics

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to create a colorful spiral dot pattern. The spiral pattern is generated by moving the turtle in a grid and changing its direction while placing colored dots at each step.

## How It Works

1. The program sets the background color to black and initializes the turtle.
2. The turtle is positioned at the starting point and the pen is lifted to prevent drawing lines.
3. A list of colors is defined for the dots.
4. The `spiral` function generates the spiral pattern by moving the turtle in a grid, changing its direction, and placing colored dots at each step.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. The turtle will automatically draw the spiral dot pattern.
