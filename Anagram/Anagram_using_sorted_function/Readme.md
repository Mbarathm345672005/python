# Finding Whether Two Strings Are Anagrams Using `sorted()`

This Python program determines whether two provided strings are anagrams by sorting their characters and comparing the sorted lists.

## How It Works

1. The program takes two input strings from the user.
2. It sorts the characters of the first string and stores the result in a list.
3. It sorts the characters of the second string and stores the result in another list.
4. It compares the two sorted lists. If they are equal, the strings are anagrams. Otherwise, they are not.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first string when prompted.
3. Enter the second string when prompted.
4. The program will output the sorted characters of both strings and indicate whether the strings are anagrams.
