# Finding Anagram by Using ASCII Values

This is a simple Python program to determine if two provided strings are anagrams. The program calculates the sum of the ASCII values of characters in both strings and compares them to check if they satisfy the condition of being an anagram.

## How It Works

1. The program takes two input strings from the user.
2. It calculates the sum of the ASCII values for each character in the first string.
3. It calculates the sum of the ASCII values for each character in the second string.
4. It compares the two sums. If they are equal, the strings are anagrams. Otherwise, they are not.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first string when prompted.
3. Enter the second string when prompted.
4. The program will output the sum of ASCII values for both strings and indicate whether the strings are anagrams.
