Birthday Paradox Simulation in Python

The Birthday Paradox (also called the Birthday Problem) is a well-known probability concept that demonstrates how surprisingly high the probability of two people sharing the same birthday is in a group of randomly chosen individuals.

This Python program simulates the Birthday Paradox by generating 50 random birthdays and sorting them based on the day of the year (1–365 or 366 for leap years). Let’s go through the logic, working, and key aspects of the program.

The output shows that the program generates birthdays as a day of the year, making it easier to identify shared birthdays among members.
The output as follow

From the output above, we can see that some birthdays (days of the year) are the same.
